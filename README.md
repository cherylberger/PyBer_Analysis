The analysis should contain the following:

Overview of the analysis: Explain the purpose of the new analysis.

# Add Matplotlib inline magic command
%matplotlib inline
# Dependencies and Setup
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import pandas as pd

# File to Load (Remember to change these)
city_data_to_load = "Resources\city_data.csv"
ride_data_to_load = "Resources/ride.csv"

# Read the City and Ride Data
city_data_df = pd.read_csv(city_data_to_load)
ride_data_df = pd.read_csv(ride_data_to_load)

# Combine the data into a single dataset
pyber_data_df = pd.merge(ride_data_df, city_data_df, how="left", on=["city", "city"])

# Display the data table for preview
pyber_data_df.head()

Results: Using images from the summary DataFrame and multiple-line chart, describe the differences in ride-sharing data among the different city types.

Using groupby statements get the data to build a summary data frame that includes the following parameters by city type:
Total Rides	Total Drivers	Total Fare	Average Fare per Ride	Average Fare per Driver

total_ride_count = pyber_data_df.groupby(["type"]).count()["ride_id"]
total_ride_count.head()

total_driver_count = pyber_data_df.groupby(["type"]).sum()["driver_count"]
total_driver_count.head()

total_fare_count = pyber_data_df.groupby(["type"]).sum()["fare"]
total_fare_count.head()

average_fares_by_type = pyber_data_df.groupby(["type"]).mean()["fare"]
average_fares_by_type

average_fare_by_driver_count = pyber_data_df.groupby(["type"]).mean()["driver_count"]
average_fare_by_driver_count.head()

PyBer_summary_df = pd.DataFrame ({'Total Rides':total_ride_count,
                 'Total Drivers':total_driver_count,
                 'Total Fare':total_fare_count, 
                 'Average Fare per Ride':average_fares_by_type, 
                 'Average Fare per Driver':average_fare_by_driver_count})

After removing the index label and formatting the data, the final summary of the ride data by type is displayed below
<Add image of formatted DataFrame>

Next, create a multiple line plot that shows the total weekly of the fares for each type of city.Â¶











Summary: Based on the results, provide three business recommendations to the CEO for addressing any disparities among the city types.
